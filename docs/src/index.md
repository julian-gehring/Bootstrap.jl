The [bootstrapping wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)) is a comprehensive summary of the topic.  An
extensive description of the bootstrap is the focus of the book *Davison and
Hinkley (1997): [Bootstrap Methods and Their Application](http://statwww.epfl.ch/davison/BMA/)*.  Most of the
methodology covered in the book is implemented in the [boot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boot/index.html) package for the [R
programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).
